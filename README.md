Analyzing Aviation Occurrences in Brazil

In this session, we will use a Notebook running Python 3.5 with Apache Spark 2.1 for data analysis and visualizations using Apache SystemML and pandas DataFrames. We'll walk through some examples of Data Preparation, Data Analysis, Scoring, Classification, Data Normalization, Correlations, Feature scaling and normalization.

We will analyze open data from Opendata AIG Brazil - Brazilian Civil Aviation Occurrences and to extract even more insights, we will explore two datasets and build charts for visualization of specific areas and see how the data science can help predicting occurrences.

Term “Occurrence” is defined as “accident or incident” throughout this data analysis.
